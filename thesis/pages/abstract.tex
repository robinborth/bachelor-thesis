When a \ac{UAV} crash, it is difficult to identify the root cause of the failure.
If we cannot identify the cause, we cannot fix the issue and, therefore, not prevent it in the future.
With semi-automatic procedures, experts manually create causal graphs to trace back the events that led to the final failure.
As it is not fully automized yet, these graphs are strongly limited in their knowledge scope and sometimes not detailed enough.
However, several sources provide a substantially wealthier knowledge base, such as online documentation and forums.
Here we build an automized pipeline that can extract the information from those resources and construct an extensive causal graph.
First, we scraped the web to gather \ac{UAV} expert knowledge by utilizing different techniques.
We then processed the information with a pre-trained \ac{NLP} model.
Next, by applying dependency patterns on the pre-processed data, we extracted \ac{CEP}s.
Finally, we merged pairs with identical meanings using a synonym dictionary generated from the corpus to build the causal graph.
With this automatized approach, we built a causal graph consisting of 3941 nodes, able to resolve issues with \ac{UAV}s efficiently.
We anticipate this thesis to be the starting point for extending our procedure to a robust and sophisticated tool or even applying it in other domains to make use of the enormous wealth of knowledge online.
